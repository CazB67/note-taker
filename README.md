The task was to create an application that can be used to write, save and delete notes. The application needed to have an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. A frontend for the application was given and I built the backend and connected the two.

## Installation
1. Create a basic Express server
2. Create html routes and check they are working. This took a while to sort through the directory structure. I also needed to add 
    `app.use(express.static('public'))` and `app.use(express.static('db'))` **server.js** to link javascript and css.
3. Create API routes - first GET was straight forward, POST and DELETE required required google fu and help with thinking it through.
4. Testing functionality and cleaning code.
